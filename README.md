In this code I build and simulate a wireless sensor network (WSN) using LEACH protocol in communicating. The parameters of the network is set then it is simulated till all nodes are dead then the analysis of the network behavior is plotted showing its lifetime and the amount of data sent before all nodes get drain their batteries.

The leach protocol is simulated between nodes, cluster heads and the base station (sink), which help reducing the amount of energy used up in the network communication process.

This software can be used in various fields like research in field of building a wireless sensor network and investigating the use of Leach protocol to save network energy
